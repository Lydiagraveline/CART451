<h3>week 4</h3>
<a href="https://archive.ph/UXlnq">Jeff Howe, "The Rise Of Crowdsourcing"</a>
<a href="http://socialturkers.com/">Lauren McCarthy: social turkers:crowdsourced dating (2013)t</a>
<a href="https://www.exhaustingacrowd.com/saintbrieuc">Kyle McDonald: Exhausting a Crowd (2015)</a>
<p>Jeff Howe's "The Rise of Crowdsourcing” describes how crowdsourcing, through companies like iStockphoto or 
    Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, has disrupted traditional industries and allowed companies to leverage/take 
    advantage of the collective power of the crowd. This concept is explored in Lauren McCarthy's project, 
    where she harnesses the power of crowdsourced workers (using the Mechanical Turk) who make real-time 
    social decisions for her while shes on a date. Her project involves sharing intimate moments with remote 
    workers, highlighting the potential intrusion of privacy in the age of technologicaly-mediated daily life.
     Another project involving an online audience is McDonald's "Exhausting a Crowd," which invites anyone via 
     the internet to write comments on surveillance footage of public spaces. These projects demonstrate how 
     technology can be used to connect individuals to larger, often remote, audiences, and used to facilitate 
     collective participation in creative endeavors. They bring into mind ethical dilemmas brought about by the 
     increasing role of remote audiences in our lives, shaping our interactions and daily life in unprecedented 
     ways, blurring the boundaries between private and public space. </p>
<p style="color:gray;">Note: I used chatGPT for the first time on this writing response (does it show?). 
    Interestingly, when I prompted it to fix spelling and grammar issues or provide article summaries, it 
    repeatedly used phrases like "harness" and "tap into" in place of phrases like "take advantage of" or 
    "exploit." Additionally it portrayed companies as using crowdsourced labor to achieve "innovative" 
    and "cost-effective" solutions, generally providing a more positive perspective on the matter…</p>
